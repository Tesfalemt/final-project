                <p>We began our journey by introducing authentic habesha Food to the Fairfield Community as food vendors at Fairfieldâ€™s
                    Saturday Farmers Markets in the summer of 2010. While working as vendors we received feedback from our customers that
                    they would like to see us open a restaurant so they can enjoy our food any day of the week. With that in mind, we received
                    the opportunity to serve at the Holy Spirit Church on Thursdays during lunch. However, this was a small step forward,
                    and we knew we wanted to give our customers more. Hence in 2015, we began serving lunch at the Fairfield Arts and Convention
                    Center 5 days a week. Our service has attracted customers not only in Fairfield but from all over Iowa. Sharing the Ethiopian
                    food and culture with the Fairfield community has been a great joy, and we are thrilled to continue to do so.</p>
